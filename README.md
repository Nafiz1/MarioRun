# MarioRun

//Nafiz Hasan and Ashad Ahmed
//This program is a Mario-inspired game in which the user has to get Mario through 3 randomly generated levels and onto the 4th level in which Bowser has held Princess
//Peach captive. In each level, the user will find platforms and the classic Mario bricks in which the user can obtain a red mushroom to transform into big Mario. For enemies, 
//level 1 has goombas, level two has goombas and spinys, level 3 has goombas, spinys, and bullet bills. Lastly, level 4 obviously has Bowser. The user starts with 5 lives,
//and if the user loses all lives they have to to restart the game. The user can also aqcuire green mushrooms that are randomly generated in the first 3 levels to gain lives. Coins are also randomly generated 
//within the first three levels, and can be used to purchase items in the shop. A chance to enter the shop is present at the end of every level. 
//The user can buy red mushrooms for 5 coins, green mushrooms for 10 coins, and fire flowers which allow Mario to shoot fireballs for 25 coins.
